Big thanks to forums.archosfans.com user 'maflow' for writing this up:

# [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Download and Install Putty]
# Start PuttyGen. Load id_arcwelder and then Save private key (confirm saving without passphrase) to any location you want (Documents for example). Name it id_arcwelder.ppk. 
# Start Putty. Select Connection-SSH-Auth. Click on Browse in the Authentication parameters section and load your private key (id_arcwelder.ppk) 
# Switch back to Session and enter Archos IP address as Host Name. Click Open. 
# Putty should open login session so login as root 
# Wait few moments until BusyBox appears
